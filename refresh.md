# PDEffer Landing Page - Project Summary

## Project Overview

PDEffer is a tool to extract structured data (tables and text) from scanned PDFs using OCR and AI, outputting DOCX files.

## Current Landing Page Status

- **Header:** Sticky top banner with brand name and navigation.
- **Floating Subtitle:** Positioned just below the banner, centered.
- **Glass Box:** Main hero section with frosted glass effect, containing welcome text and short description.
- **Footer:** Planned as a flexbox with legal info, contact, etc.
- **Layout:** Inspired by a visual mockup (Imgur sketch), organized into multiple flex containers.

## Color Palette

- #98F587 (green)
- #F5CD87 (warm yellow)
- #87BAF5 (cool blue)
- #F587D6 (pink - used for neon glow)
- #8D96A0 (neutral gray)
- #5C7558 (dark green)

## Styling Decisions

- Neon pink (#F587D6) glow around two small boxes left and right of the brand name.
- Glow is steady, subtle, tasteful, no pulsing.
- Background: dark gradient or similar.
- Vanilla CSS only, no Tailwind.

## Next Steps

- Implement neon glow CSS on the two small boxes.
- Plan content for remaining five flexbox areas based on design philosophy.
- Further styling and layout adjustments as needed.
