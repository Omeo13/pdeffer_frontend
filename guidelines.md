1. Visual & Technical Aesthetic
   Color Palette (Light Mode Default)

Base: clean, bright whites or very light grays for backgrounds (#f9fafb or similar).

Accents: vibrant purples, blues, or cyans for highlights and interactive elements.

Use subtle shadows and layering to create depth without heaviness.

Text: dark charcoal or near-black for maximum readability.

Light mode should feel spacious, modern, and highly legible.

Dark Mode Option

Dark backgrounds: deep navy or charcoal.

Accents shift to neon purples, blues, and cyans with subtle glows.

Text colors become lighter shades for contrast.

Transitions between modes should be smooth and user-friendly.

Typography

Crisp geometric sans-serif fonts (Inter, Roboto Mono, or similar).

Clear hierarchy with bold headings and comfortably sized body text.

Slight letter spacing on headings for technical polish.

UI Components

Panels with subtle shadows and rounded corners for a soft yet precise feel.

Borders and separators to create structure without clutter.

Buttons with bold accent colors and hover/focus effects.

Use line-based, minimalistic icons consistent across modes.

2. Layout & Interaction
   Landing Page

Light, spacious hero section with bold messaging and clear CTAs.

Background can have subtle geometric or grid patterns for tech feel.

Responsive design with smooth scaling and padding.

Command Center Interface

Modular dashboard with panels that feel “light” and easy to scan.

Side navigation with clear labels and icons, collapsible on smaller screens.

Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility baked in.

Dark mode toggle visible and easy to switch anywhere.

3. User Experience & Feel
   Feedback & States

Crisp animations and smooth transitions.

Clear, immediate feedback on user interactions.

Visual states consistent across light and dark modes.

Accessibility

Strong color contrast in both modes.

Support screen readers, keyboard navigation.

Adjustable font sizes and spacing.

4. Development & Maintenance
   Use clean, modular CSS supporting both modes via CSS variables or class toggles.

Prefer utility classes or CSS-in-JS that enable easy theming.

Ensure toggling modes doesn’t cause layout shifts or flicker.

Document theme colors and variables clearly.
